## What were you doing before the bootcamp?

I was working as a development manager at a number of local companies doing .NET development.

## What do you hope to get out of the bootcamp?

I hope to quickly learn how to be a professional developer and get a job in the field.

## What job you'd like to be working at after gradutation?

I'd prefer to be working at a company that has sofware as its primary product.

## If I got to choose that application that I'd build for the final project, what would it be? 

I'd finish that compiler that I started some time ago.
